						"Universa universis patavina libertas" is the motto that has always characterized the University of Padova, recognized for cultural openness and freedom of expression that prompted centuries ago a group of students and teachers to leave the University of Bologna for Padua and shared by the Paduan students today; these factors also converge in Race UP, which helps make the University of Padua a benchmark for excellence in training and in research studies internationally.</p>
