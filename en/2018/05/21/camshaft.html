<p>Camshaft is a distribution axle that commands the air (or fuel mixture) intake and exhaust fumes outflow from the combustion chamber. It can do this because it controls specific valves (suction valves and exhaust valves) that are positioned on the head of cylinders. Usually camshaft is manufactured in steel and cast iron.<br />
In the past, it was opted for an auctions and barbells distribution system: the camshaft was positioned sidelong the engine and it push auctions that commanded barbells; barbells through tappets opened and closed the valves. Tappets are mechanical parts with a cylindrical shape that transmit the motion to the valves through push way.<br />
Currently the camshaft positioned above the engine is the most used system: it is more easy and reliable than the previous system. The distribution axle can directly activate valves through sliding or roller tappets (direct distribution) or through levers called barbells (indirect distribution).</p>

<p>How it works?</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2018/05/22/schemaen.jpg" alt="Schema" /></p>

<p>Camshaft is composed of “eccentrics” with a form like a drop, that are called cams. Every cam controls a specific valve (suction or exhaust valves). The camshaft, rotating, allows cams to open valves pushing the tappets. When on the tappets there will be the cam heel the valve will close because there isn’t the sufficient strength to contrast the valve booster spring. <br />
The cam geometry has an important role relating the engine performance: the cam tip curvature allows valves openings and closures more or less “abrupt”. Pointy cams allow more fast and clear openings but they caused a high stress for the cam stem. Cams more flat will open valves more gradually, reducing the stress.<br />
At high regimes tappets may not remain in contact with the eccentric (causing the so-called engine flickering). To restrict damages, all the “tappets play” must be eliminated. The most adopted solutions are hydraulic tappets and desmodromic distribution.<br />
In high performance engines usually there are two suction valves and one or two exhaust valves for every cylinder. To activate more than one valve for cylinder it needs two camshafts. <br />
Camshaft is connected to the crankshaft via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain; in particular, crankshaft determines the camshaft motion. Valves opening and closures must be in the right engine phase to allow a right engine operation: this happens thanks to the engine timing procedure that identify the opening point and the closure point of the valves compared to the piston position. Particularly interesting is the determination of the valves crossing angle: it is the crankshaft rotation angle when both the suction valves and the exhaust valves are open (it happens in the beginning of suction phase and in the end of exhaust phase). It depends on the suction cams inclination with respect to the exhaust cams. A high crossing angle exploits the inertia of combusted gases that continue to flow towards the exhaust pipes even when the piston has reached the top dead point; this allows: <br />
-a depression effect that is able to recall the fresh air in the cylinder more quickly and so a “dynamic overfeed” (but only at high speeds)<br />
-to increase the suction phase amplitude and so the optimal filling of the cylinders (volumetric efficiency).<br />
On the other hand, it could cause the unburned fuel escaping from the exhaust pipe (because the exhaust valve closes with delay) and power loss at medium and low speeds due to reflux of the mixture in the intake ducts. <br />
There will be interesting solutions to allow best engine performance acting on camshaft and on the valves crossing angle. These solutions are the so-called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1gab4MHcSU">engine phase variators</a>: from the Alfa Romeo mechanical system <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Knt-3IUVj8">VTC</a> to electronic systems like Variocam (Porsche), Valve lift (Audi), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-T0gNrNm8w">VTEC</a> (Honda) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLwMbgDUDnw">Multiair</a> (Fiat)</p>

<p>Our Camshaft</p>

<p>Our engine is composed by two camshafts, one controls the suction valves and the other controls the exhaust valves, with a direct distribution system through tappets that push titanium valves. This material is lighter than conventional materials (steel) and allows a more precise control of their movement by optimizing the synchronism and the duration of opening and closing phases.<br />
Cam machining: The cam bends have been modified to allow a delayed closing of the intake valves (promoting a crossing of the valves) in order to be able to have a good volumetric efficiency, exploiting the depression effect (reflux) created by the leakage of the exhaust gases and the decrease in density due to the variation in air temperature. The generated depression also favors the re-aspiration of the combustion gases (that may have entered the suction duct during the valve crossing) and the “washing” of the combustion chamber.<br />
The cams have also been beveled to reduce the stress on the valve stem; this leads to a reduced valve lift. However, thanks to the titanium valves, lighter and easier to control, we still manage to increase their lift and therefore have an increase in torque (since more air comes in and the engine “breathes” better) and an increase in power at high rpm.</p>
